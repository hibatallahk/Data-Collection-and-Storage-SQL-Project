# Data-Collection-and-Storage-SQL-Project
You're working as an analyst for Zuber, a new ride-sharing company that's launching in Chicago. Your task is to find patterns in the available information. You want to understand passenger preferences and the impact of external factors on rides.
You'll study a database, analyze data from competitors, and test a hypothesis about the impact of weather on ride frequency.
In this task, you'll complete the first step of the project.

Write a code to parse the data on weather in Chicago in November 2017 from the website:

The name of the DataFrame should be weather_records, and it should be specified when you search: attrs={"id": "weather_records"} . Print the DataFrame in its entirety.
